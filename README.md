# LYNY-v2.1
Lyny is a small car project designed for remote control using both traditional methods through the Blynk app and cutting-edge hand gesture recognition using OpenCV. The hardware is built around an ESP32 microcontroller and an L298N motor driver, providing a versatile and interactive platform for experimentation.
